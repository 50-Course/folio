Documentiing my learning progress in a single repository. This space would contain past and current links to my project/product-based learning. Here's a tip-off, the branches are named in ```yr-{year}``` to properly document my learning journey starting today **April 2022**.

You may want to overlook previous projects before this date, I would be keeping them year because they form the basis, and am still proud of them.
